# Tasks & Roadmap: trading-bot-system

This document tracks the current implementation status, outstanding tasks, and long-term/extension ideas for the `trading-bot-system` directory.

---

## 1. Current Directory Structure & Core Files

- `.env.template`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `nginx.conf`
- `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `server.js`
- `sql/init.sql`
- `src/`
  - `database/index.js`
  - `routes/health.js`, `routes/index.js`, `routes/trading.js`
  - `services/sentiment.js`
  - `trading/` (structure unknown, see TODO)
  - `utils/logger.js`, `utils/response.js`

---

## 2. What’s Been Implemented

### Core Backend

- **Database Layer**
  - [x] `src/database/index.js`: Handles DB connection logic.
  - [x] `sql/init.sql`: Schema and/or seed data.

- **API Routing**
  - [x] `src/routes/health.js`: Healthcheck endpoint.
  - [x] `src/routes/index.js`: Likely main API entry point.
  - [x] `src/routes/trading.js`: Core trading endpoints (substantial file size indicates significant logic).

- **Service Layer**
  - [x] `src/services/sentiment.js`: Sentiment analysis (for strategies, signals, or risk management).

- **Utilities**
  - [x] `src/utils/logger.js`: Logging abstraction.
  - [x] `src/utils/response.js`: Standardized API responses.

- **Containerization/Deployment**
  - [x] Dockerized (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `nginx.conf`)
  - [x] Environment templating (`.env.template`)

## 3. What’s Left to Be Implemented

### Core/Immediate

- [ ] **Trading Logic**  
  - Investigate and document `src/trading/` contents
  - Modularize strategy, order management, and trade execution logic

- [ ] **Modular Brokerage Integration**
  - Abstraction for plugging in new broker APIs (REST, WebSocket, etc.)
  - Broker interface/adapter pattern
  - Configuration for selecting broker per-bot or per-user

- [ ] **Bot Lifecycle Management**
  - Creation, editing, deletion of bots
  - State transitions (running, paused, stopped, error, etc.)
  - Persistence of bot state

- [ ] **User Authentication & Accounts**
  - User/session management (JWT/OAuth/etc.)
  - Role/permission support

- [ ] **Web UI**
  - UI for managing bots, monitoring trades, updating strategies

- [ ] **Backtesting & Simulation**
  - Run bots or strategies on historical data
  - Result visualization

- [ ] **Alerting/Notifications**
  - Email, SMS, or web push for trades, errors, or system events

- [ ] **Tests**
  - Unit and integration tests across modules

---

## 4. V2 / Stretch Goals / Extensions

### Modular Trading & Extensibility

- [ ] **Plug-in/Extension System**
  - Allow third-party or custom strategies as plug-ins
  - Scriptable bots (e.g., via JS/Python sandboxing)

- [ ] **Brokerage Marketplace**
  - UI for discovering and enabling new brokers
  - Community broker templates

- [ ] **Strategy Marketplace**
  - Community sharing of bot configs/strategies

- [ ] **Advanced Analytics**
  - Trade analytics dashboards
  - Real-time performance charts

- [ ] **Risk Management Module**
  - Portfolio risk controls, stop-losses, max drawdown, etc.

- [ ] **Paper Trading Mode**
  - Simulated trading with real-time market data

- [ ] **Multi-Asset Support**
  - Beyond crypto/stocks: support for FX, commodities, etc.

- [ ] **Mobile App**
  - Companion app for monitoring and notifications

- [ ] **AI/ML Integration**
  - ML-driven strategies, signal generation, anomaly detection

---

## 5. Observed Gaps / TODOs

- [ ] Audit `src/trading/`, confirm modularity and extensibility
- [ ] Document API endpoints (Swagger/OpenAPI recommended)
- [ ] Clarify separation between backend, frontend, and bot execution engines

---

## 6. How to Update

- Move items from "Left to be Implemented" to "Implemented" as they are completed.
- Add architecture/extension ideas to "Stretch Goals".
- Keep in sync with codebase and major PRs.

*This roadmap should be revised as the system matures and as contributors propose new features or extensions.*
